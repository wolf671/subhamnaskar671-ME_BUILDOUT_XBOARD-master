This project serves as a demonstration of the effective utilization of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies to create a responsive and visually appealing news feed website. It utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve data from multiple RSS feeds and showcases the content using Bootstrap components.

- **News Aggregation**: Crio Feed efficiently collects news articles from a diverse range of RSS feeds, neatly presenting them in an easy-to-navigate accordion-style layout. Users can quickly access news from different sources.

- **Image Carousel**: Each news article is enriched with an immersive image carousel feature, enabling users to scroll through a collection of captivating images associated with the article. This interactive element enhances the storytelling experience.

- **Card View**: News articles are elegantly displayed in visually appealing cards, complete with titles, author information, publication dates, and concise descriptions. The card layout provides a structured and engaging presentation of news content.
